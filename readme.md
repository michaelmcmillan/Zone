An open source alternative Sonos player.

![Screenshot](assets/screens/screenshot.png)

### Why
The official Sonos Player in its current state is horrible. I believe that open source always will produce better software.

### How
This repository contains the source code for a node-webkit package. Node-webkit makes it easy to produce cross-platform software by using web technology like node.js.

### Contribute
I will post more information on how to contribute later.
