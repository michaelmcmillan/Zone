# Zone
An open source alternative to the Sonos controller.

### Why
The official Sonos Player in its current state is horrible. I believe that open source always will produce better software.

### How
This repository contains the source code for a node-webkit package. Node-webkit makes it easy to produce cross-platform software by using web technology like node.js.

### Contribute
To contribute all you have to do is run the following commands. Make sure you have Node.js, NPMi, Grunt and Bower installed first.
````bash
git clone git@github.com:michaelmcmillan/Zone.git && cd Zone
npm install
bower install
grunt build
````
